# Sam Thompson's Portfolio!

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to show off myself as a web developer by both giving information about myself, and showing a litte of what I can do with the website itself.

## Technologies used
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Stylish Bootstrap Portfolio template
* Animate.js
* 3D paint (to make backgrounds)

## process

This template started off pretty basic looking, with some nice functionality built in. I added my information, and quite a bit of my own styling, and completely removed some sections. I used Microsoft 3D paint to edit the background for the About me section, I feel like that adds a bit of a personal feel to the page.
